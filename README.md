#Full-Stack PERN Project: Contact List App

#Introduction#

I have learned how to create a full-stack app with a React frontend, Node/Express backend, and Postgres database (PERN). This project is to practice putting it all together by building a fairly simple app from start to finish.

***

##Instructions/Notes##

*For this project, you can reference previous lessons and find your own resources online. *This should be good practice finding resources and getting the help you need to make your code work without step-by-step instructions.
*You must use Express, React, and Postgres. You can choose what other technologies and libraries you want to use as well as part of the project.
*All code should be your own or become your own, i.e. you should understand what it's doing, even if it's a snippet from StackOverflow. If you get an idea from somewhere or someone, please add an attribution note in a comment.
*Styling/CSS is not important for this assignment, but once the behavior is working, please feel free to make it look nice.
